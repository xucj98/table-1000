"""A batch of trajectories in ``data/scenes/<scene>/<backend>/``, without changing Isaac Lab's HDF5 format.

``trajectories.hdf5`` and ``trajectories_failed.hdf5`` hold one ``data/demo_<seed>``
group per episode; the processes of a batch write their own files, merged at the
end (:func:`merge`). Videos sit next to them, those of succeeded episodes in
``videos/``, of failed ones in ``fails/``: ``<seed>/<camera>.mp4`` per camera,
``<seed>/merge.mp4`` for the cameras merged into one. Each is encoded
elsewhere and moved in when complete, so an interrupted render leaves nothing
half-written.
