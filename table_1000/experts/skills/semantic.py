"""Semantic skills: open and close a jointed part, put an object on a surface or into a container.

Each skill takes what to do in the terms of the scene (an object, its joint, a
surface) and works out the rest from the assets' collision geometry and joints:

- **open** / **close** -- the joint's axis gives the direction its child body moves
  (a slider's positive travel: a drawer pulled out); the handle is the part named
  ``handle`` of that body. ``open`` grasps the handle straight at it (the angle from
  straight relaxed through ``OPEN_ANGLES``), moves it along the axis and lets go; where
  the hand cannot follow it all the way it slides it part way and grasps again
  (``PULLS`` in all), letting go first when a pull fails. ``close`` pushes the handle
  back with the closed fingertips.
- **place_on** / **place_inside** -- the region to put an object down in is found by
  casting rays straight down over the support (the table, or a body or part of an
  object) at the live poses of everything in the scene: the cells whose first hit is
  an upward face of the support bound the region (on a surface the highest such face,
  in a container the lowest: its floor, not its rims); whatever is hit first inside it
  instead (an object standing on the table, the cabinet over the part of a drawer still
  inside it) is kept out by the collision box of its body, unless it is higher than the
  object sweeps coming down. :func:`~table_1000.experts.skills.place` then puts the
  object down there, near a given point (within ``NEAR`` of it).
- **predicates** -- :func:`opening`, :func:`is_open`, :func:`is_closed`, :func:`on`,
  :func:`inside`: what the skills check when they are done, and what an expert's
  ``Step.check`` asks (:func:`require`).

Each skill runs under :func:`~table_1000.experts.skills.retry`. Joints are named as in
the asset's ``model.json`` (``cabinet.drawer1.slide``). Revolute joints (doors) are
not handled yet: their handle moves along an arc.
