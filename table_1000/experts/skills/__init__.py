"""Atomic skills for experts: grasp, pick, move by a displacement, push, release, place.

Named after RoboTwin 2.0's task API (``grasp_actor``, ``move_by_displacement``,
``place_actor``, ``open_gripper``/``close_gripper``) but blocking like the rest of
``solve(ctx)``: each call returns when the motion is done, checked in the
simulation, and fails the subtask (:class:`~table_1000.experts.context.ExpertFailed`,
or :class:`~table_1000.experts.solver.PlanningFailed` for a move that cannot be
planned) when it is not. Lower-level moves stay available through
``ctx.solver(arm)`` and mix freely with these::

    from table_1000.experts import skills

    g = skills.grasp(ctx, 'cabinet', 'cabinet.drawer1.handle', then=-pull)  # either arm, the nearer first
    skills.move_by_displacement(ctx, g['arm'], *-pull, drag=('cabinet', 'cabinet.drawer1'))
    skills.release(ctx, g['arm'])
    p = skills.pick(ctx, 'pen')                                              # grasp, then lift
    skills.place(ctx, 'pen', (table_frame, (x0, y0), (x1, y1)), near=(x, y, table_height))

What is grasped is an object of the scene (an asset, by name), or a part or body
of it: its shape is the collision box of that part in the frame of its body, or
one given (a :class:`~table_1000.experts.grasps.Box` or
:class:`~table_1000.experts.grasps.Cylinder` placed by ``offset`` in the body
frame, also for a scene primitive that is not an asset). Every asset of the scene
is in each arm's planning world, one planning object per part (``<object>:<part>``);
the table too.

Each skill reaches with the least of the robot it can, in this order: one arm with the torso
lift where it is, the other arm so, the torso lift moving too, the free arms that are out back
at their start pose (where none is in reach as they are), then the base moving
(:func:`make_room`); a free-space plan (RRTConnect) that may move the torso lift holds it first
where its goal leaves it where it is.

**grasp** -- candidates of the shape at its live pose
(:func:`~table_1000.experts.grasps.grasp_candidates`, cheapest first: close to the
``approach`` direction, default reaching out and down from the arm's shoulder;
centred on ``point``, default the shape's centre) are tried per arm, the arm whose
shoulder is nearer first, in the order above (where none is in reach, the base first moves
to reach the first ones). Every other planning object is an obstacle of the
candidates' hand; the ones within ``SUPPORT_DISTANCE`` of the shape are its supports,
which the hand may touch (overlapping them by at most ``-SUPPORT_CLEARANCE``). A
candidate is kept when the grasp and a pre-grasp ``APPROACH`` behind it have
collision-free IK solutions, and so does the grasp moved by ``then`` (the motion that
follows, if given), straight all along; a ``then`` other than a lift up also needs the hand to
leave straight back ``APPROACH`` from its end, where it lets go (a drawer pulled up to the body
leaves the arm no room to). The hand plans (RRTConnect) to the
pre-grasp with the fingers open to the object's width plus a margin, moves straight
in (the only move in which the fingers may touch the object), and closes; the finger
gap must stop within ``HELD_TOLERANCE`` of the gap at which the pads touch the object, else it backs out, re-observes the
object and chooses again (at most ``MAX_REGRASPS`` times). The grasped part then
moves with the hand in the planning world until :func:`release`.

**move_by_displacement** -- the TCP straight by a world displacement, with the torso
lift too where the arm alone runs into a joint limit, or (``least``) as far along as
plans; straight up beyond the arm's reach, the torso lift rises and the arm does the rest. ``drag``
names a body moved through a joint by the held part (a drawer pulled by its
handle): its planning objects move with the hand and may touch the rest of their
object and whatever rests on them.

**push** -- the closed fingertips against the face of a part that ``direction``
points into, then straight on by ``distance`` (a drawer pushed shut by its front);
the hand comes level with the push or tilted down (``PUSH_TILTS``), and what the
part's body carries moves with it as in a drag; where none is in reach, the base first moves to
reach the first ones.

**release** -- open the fingers to the grasp's opening and back out along the
approach (or up).

**place** -- put the held object down anywhere in a region: a rectangle on a surface
(a frame whose z = 0 plane is the surface), its footprint inside by a margin and out
of keep-out rectangles. Positions every ``PLACE_STEP`` and turns about the surface
normal every ``PLACE_TURN_STEP`` are ranked nearest a given point, then least turned
(``PLACE_TURNS`` per position);
IK screens them above and at the release (``MAX_PLACE_IK``), and the first of those that has a motion
(``MAX_PLACES`` planned) is taken: above it, straight down to ``clearance`` over the
surface, then :func:`release`.

**make_room** -- move the base to where given TCP poses (each a pose, or the poses along a
straight move) are reachable with every joint a margin inside its limits: where it stands
if they are, else the base pose that it gets to soonest among poses sampled around them
(facing them, at a distance), the robot clear of the planning world there and on the way
(the table's legs included). The free arms go back to their start pose first where they would
sweep something on the way; the base turns in place, drives straight and turns in place. Given no poses, the base goes back to where it
started.

**handover** -- the held object passed to the other hand, held as the next action needs
(:mod:`~table_1000.experts.skills.handover`, after WRS): the giving arm brings it in front of the
body, the receiving one grasps it, the giving one lets go.

**ready** -- the arms that hold nothing back at their start pose (each step then starts
alike, out of the way of the other arm).

**retry** -- a step run again when it fails (``ATTEMPTS`` in all), the arms that hold nothing back at their start pose
first, so that its choices start afresh; not when nothing was in reach (``Unreachable``: the
planners sampled their candidates already, a high share of it points at the planning).

**chain** -- actions (:class:`Pick`, :class:`Place`) run in order, each asked for what the next
needs of it: a place needs the object held by a hand, and with a hold, from which one of its
placements is in reach (an :class:`InHand`), and the pick takes only such grasps; where none is in
reach (:class:`Unmet`) the object is picked as it can be and handed over to the other hand, else
the pick runs again with the base free to move (see :mod:`~table_1000.experts.skills.chain`)::

    skills.chain(ctx, [skills.Pick('pen', instruction='pick up the pen from the table'),
                       skills.Place('pen', region, near=point, instruction='put the pen into the drawer')])

Each choice of another candidate is noted (``ctx.note``). A skill that finds nothing in reach
(no grasp, push or placement) fails with :class:`~table_1000.experts.context.Unreachable`.

The skills are one :class:`Skills` per context (``ctx.skills()``), put together from
``grasping`` (grasp, pick), ``handover``, ``motion`` (straight moves, push, release), ``placing`` and ``base``
(the base, ready); ``common`` holds what they share.
