"""Actions run in a chain: what one needs of the one before is asked of it, and met otherwise.

An expert says what to do with the objects; :func:`chain` runs the actions in order, each asked
for what the next needs of it (its :meth:`Action.requirements`: an :class:`InHand` for a place,
the hands and holds from which the object is put down). Where an action cannot meet that
(:class:`~table_1000.experts.skills.common.Unmet`), it is done as it can and the need is met
after, the first of ``adapt`` that does: ``'base'`` (the action again with the need and the base
free to move: one stance from which it is done and the next one can be, a pick and the place of
what it holds), ``'handover'`` (done as it can, then the object handed to the other hand, held as
needed; what is still unmet is left to the next action, which may move the base itself).
