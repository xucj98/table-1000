"""Handover: the held object passed from one hand to the other, held as the next action needs.

After WRS (wanweiwei07/wrs, MIT), ``manipulation/placement/handover.py``: a handover pose of the
object is kept where the giving hand reaches it with its hold, there is a receiving grasp whose
hand is clear of the giving one, and the receiving arm reaches that grasp with the giving arm at
its pose. WRS screens such poses offline into a library searched as a graph; here they are
screened as needed, one handover ahead, in front of the body between the shoulders (``REACH`` ahead,
``SIDES`` toward the giving one, ``HEIGHTS`` above where the object is, the object turned by ``TURNS``
about the vertical).

The giving arm plans to the first pose whose screening passes, the receiving one to the pre-grasp
and straight in, closes and must hold; then the giving hand lets go and backs out
(:meth:`~table_1000.experts.skills.motion.Motion.release`). The torso lift, shared by the
arms, moves only with the giving arm, before the receiving one reaches.
