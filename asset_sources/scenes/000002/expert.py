"""Expert of scene 000002: move the pen from the cabinet's top drawer to its bottom drawer, by way of the table.

Open the top drawer, take the pen out, put it on the table, close the top
drawer; open the bottom drawer, pick the pen up from the table, put it in, close
it. Written with the semantic skills of :mod:`table_1000.experts.skills.semantic`
(handles, pull directions and places to put the pen come from the cabinet's
geometry and joints) and the atomic ones under them; which arm, and where the
base stands, the skills choose.
