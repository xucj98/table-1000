"""Scene 000002: X1Pro (pivoting RM001 grippers) at a table with a three-drawer cabinet; a pen in its top drawer.

World frame: origin on the floor below the table centre, +Z up. The robot
stands in front of the table's -Y edge facing +Y, its centre ``GAP`` from the
edge (the chassis reaches under the table). The cabinet stands anywhere in the arms' reach (either arm), turned
to face the robot within +-15 degrees; the pen lies in the closed top drawer, in
the part that comes out when the drawer opens, along the drawer's width.
